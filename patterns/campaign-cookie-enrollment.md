# Pattern: Campaign Cookie Enrollment

## Trigger

**Keywords** (must appear in feature name, ticket, or description):
- campaign
- cookie
- `_join_inputValues`
- landing page
- enrollment

**Conditions** (any of these):
- Feature involves registering new users from a campaign landing page
- Feature has modals gated on backend `campaign_modal` state
- Feature uses `_join_inputValues` cookie to track campaign source

**Confidence Threshold**: 4

## Cookie Payload

### Minimal (enrollment only — no form pre-population)

```js
const payload = btoa(JSON.stringify({
  submission_uid: crypto.randomUUID()  // MUST be real UUID — Str::isUuid() validated in BE
}));
document.cookie = `_join_inputValues=${payload}; domain=.members-testqa.seeking.com; path=/`;
```

Use this for testing modals and enrollment logic where form pre-population is not the AC under test.

### Full (enrollment + join form auto-population — Req.4 / AC: form pre-fill from cookie)

**Default: Generous (Male) User**
```js
const payload = btoa(JSON.stringify({
  submission_uid: crypto.randomUUID(),   // MUST be real UUID
  sex: "3",                              // Male
  gender_preference: ["248"],            // Female preference ID
  email: `khan+gen${Date.now()}@incube8.sg`,
  dob: 631152000,                        // Unix timestamp (seconds)
  account_type: "1",
  source: undefined                      // BUC 2026 — no source. Future: "revolve", etc.
}));
document.cookie = `_join_inputValues=${payload}; domain=.members-testqa.seeking.com; path=/`;
```

**Default: Attractive (Female) User**
```js
const payload = btoa(JSON.stringify({
  submission_uid: crypto.randomUUID(),   // MUST be real UUID
  sex: "4",                              // Female
  gender_preference: ["247"],            // Male preference ID
  email: `khan+attr${Date.now()}@incube8.sg`,
  dob: 631152000,                        // Unix timestamp (seconds)
  account_type: "2",
  source: undefined                      // BUC 2026 — no source. Future: "revolve", etc.
}));
document.cookie = `_join_inputValues=${payload}; domain=.members-testqa.seeking.com; path=/`;
```

### Field Reference (from FE source — DO NOT GUESS)

| Field | Type | Valid Values | Notes |
|-------|------|-------------|-------|
| `submission_uid` | string | Any UUID | BE-validated, required for enrollment |
| `sex` | string | `"3"` (Male), `"4"` (Female) | API attribute ID — NOT "male"/"female" |
| `gender_preference` | string[] or string | API preference IDs or `"999"` (Everyone) | Array preferred; legacy comma-string also accepted |
| `email` | string | RFC email format | Regex-validated |
| `dob` | number or string | Unix timestamp (seconds) OR `"MM/DD/YYYY"` / `"DD/MM/YYYY"` | Format auto-detected by IP country. Unix timestamp is safest. |
| `bdayDay` | string | `"1"`–`"31"` | Fallback if `dob` absent |
| `bdayMonth` | string | `"1"`–`"12"` | Fallback if `dob` absent |
| `bdayYear` | string | 4-digit year | Fallback if `dob` absent |
| `account_type` | string | `"1"`, `"2"` | Auto-derived from `sex` if omitted |
| `source` | string or undefined | Campaign name e.g. `"revolve"` | Absent for BUC 2026. Future campaigns should include campaign name. |

**BUC 2026**: Only `submission_uid` is required for enrollment. Other fields enable form pre-population per Req.4.

> ⚠️ **DOB as ISO string (`"1999-03-15"`) is WRONG** — FE spinbutton rejects it with a format error. Use Unix timestamp or `bdayDay`/`bdayMonth`/`bdayYear` separately.

---

## Cookie Set Protocol

> ⚠️ **Set cookie BEFORE visiting `/join` for the first time.** Cookie detection runs on page load — setting cookie while already on `/join` and refreshing works, but the safest approach is:

```
1. Navigate to any page on the domain (e.g. /login)
2. Set cookie via browser_evaluate
3. Navigate to /join (first visit with cookie present)
```

Cookie is **removed by FE** after successful parsing on Join page load (`removeCookie('_join_inputValues', 1, 's')` — `Join.tsx` line 219). This is expected.

---

## Form Auto-Population Behaviour (Req.4)

**Source**: `FE_REPO/resources/react-app/components/auth/Join.tsx` lines 304–344

When cookie is present on `/join` load:
- Step 1 (gender/interest): pre-selected if `sex` + `gender_preference` valid → **FE skips to Step 2**
- Step 2 (DOB): pre-filled if `dob` or `bdayDay/Month/Year` valid → **FE skips to Step 3**
- Step 3 (email): pre-filled if `email` valid

If fields are invalid or absent, FE stops at that step and shows it empty. Missing `sex`/`gender_preference` → stops at Step 1.

**To verify auto-population**: after setting full cookie and navigating to `/join`, the form should open directly at Step 3 (email) with gender/DOB already set — not Step 1.

---

## Protocol

When this pattern is matched, use this setup sequence:

### Stage 3 — Test User Setup

1. Navigate to `/login` (or any non-join page on the domain)
2. Set `_join_inputValues` cookie (full payload if testing Req.4, minimal if testing modals only)
3. Navigate to `/join` — **first visit with cookie present**
4. If testing Req.4: verify form opens at correct step with pre-populated fields
5. Complete registration (fill any remaining steps manually)
6. Complete IPCF onboarding
7. **Verify `CampaignInfoModal`** appears during IPCF — testid: `campaign-notice-modal`. Absence = enrollment failed.
8. For modals requiring **liveness + approval**:
   - Step A: Simulate liveness FIRST — `POST /v3/liveness/qa-callback?is_metadata=0` with `{ uid: "<user_uid>", recommendation: "APPROVE" }` (uppercase)
   - Step B: THEN force-approve — `GET /v3/users/<uid>/force-approve-profile`
9. Click **"View members"** on IPCF last page — `profile_completed` or redemption modal appears
10. To trigger `offer_pending_approval`: navigate to `/billing/memberships`

### Stage 5 — Business Logic Verification

| Modal | User Type | Precondition | Trigger |
|-------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| `not_eligible` | Any existing member | Logged in | Set cookie (minimal), navigate to `/member` |
| `CampaignInfoModal` | New BUC-enrolled user | Cookie set before registration | Appears during IPCF automatically |
| `profile_completed` | Any enrolled user | IPCF complete, **pending approval** | Click "View members" on IPCF last page |
| `gold_redemption_successful` | Attractive, enrolled | Liveness first → then approve | Click "View members" after force-approve |
| `gold_redemption_extended` | Attractive, enrolled | Has Gold already, then liveness+approve | Click "View members" |
| `boost_redemption_successful` | Generous, enrolled | Liveness first → then approve | Click "View members" |
| `offer_pending_approval` | Attractive, enrolled | Liveness+approved, no gold yet | Navigate to `/billing/memberships` |
| `offer_expired` | Any enrolled | Expired offer | ⚠️ No QA endpoint — not testable on testqa |

---

## Termination Conditions

| If | Then |
|----|------|
| `CampaignInfoModal` does NOT appear during IPCF | FAIL — enrollment failed; check cookie was set before `/join` and `submission_uid` is a valid UUID |
| Join form opens at Step 3 (email) with fields pre-filled | PASS — Req.4 auto-population working |
| Join form opens at Step 1 with empty fields despite full cookie | FAIL — Req.4 not working; check field names against FE source |
| Modal appears on correct route with correct title/body | PASS |
| Modal appears on wrong route (e.g. `offer_pending_approval` on `/member`) | FAIL — route restriction broken |
| Subscription/boost system unresponsive on testqa | INCONCLUSIVE — note environment limitation |
| `offer_expired` modal cannot be triggered | INCONCLUSIVE — no QA mechanism |

---

## Common Pitfalls

- **Wrong UUID format**: `"test-uid-" + Date.now()` fails `Str::isUuid()`. Always use `crypto.randomUUID()`.
- **Wrong `sex` value**: `"male"` is invalid — must be `"3"` (Male) or `"4"` (Female) API attribute ID.
- **Wrong DOB format**: ISO string `"1999-03-15"` is rejected. Use Unix timestamp or `bdayDay`/`bdayMonth`/`bdayYear`.
- **Cookie set after visiting /join**: Cookie is parsed once on page load and then removed. Setting cookie while on /join and refreshing may work but is unreliable. Set before first visit.
- **Wrong approval order**: Force-approve BEFORE liveness → gift redemption never fires. Always: **liveness → then approve**.
- **Modal click timing in Playwright**: `not_eligible` modal auto-dismisses fast. Do NOT snapshot before clicking — use `browser_wait_for(text)` then immediately `browser_evaluate` to click the button. Snapshotting first causes stale ref.
- **Cookie removal after not_eligible**: Cookie is only removed on explicit button click (Continue/Close), not on auto-dismiss.

## Known Instances

| Date | Ticket | Outcome | Notes |
|------|--------|---------|-------|
| 2026-03-15 | SATHREE-41277 | PARTIAL | BUC 2026 first run. 4/7 modals verified. 3 blocked by wrong liveness order. offer_expired untestable on testqa. |
| 2026-03-15 | SATHREE-41277 | PARTIAL | Re-run. not_eligible PASS. Form auto-population stopped early — cookie field names were wrong (guessed vs source). Correct field names now documented above. |
